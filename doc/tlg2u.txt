TLG2U(1)                         User Commands                        TLG2U(1)



NAME
       tlg2u - Decode beta coded text to Unicode (utf-8) and print to the
       standard output

SYNOPSIS
       tlg2u [OPTIONS] FILE

DESCRIPTION
       The tlg2gu(1) command converts beta coded texts, from the Thesaurus
       Lingua Graeca (TLG) and the Packard Humanities Institute (PHI5/7)
       corpora in CD-ROM, to utf-8 encoded text and prints to the standard
       output. It can convert whole files when giving a filename or single
       texts by specifying the corpus, the author id and the work id.

OPTIONS
       If FILE is specified then options -a, -b, -B and -d are ignored and the
       whole file is converted.

       -a nnnn
           Author, 4 digit id code.

       -b nnn
           Book, 3 digit id code.

       -c corpus_id
           Must be one of: tlg, lat, civ, ddp, ins or chr.

       -C
           Print all citation numbers on the left margin.

       -d <path to corpus files>
           Corpus directory path. e.g. /usr/cdroms/tlg.

       -G
           Greek text (default). Specify this if text is mainly Greek.

       -h
           Print usage information.

       -l
           Print line numbers on the right margin. (Every fith line).

       -L
           Latin text. Specify this if text is mainly latin. Use this option
           for the Latin corpus (lat), canon files (doccan) or author tables
           (authtab.dir).

       -m
           Print marginalia on the right margin.

       -m
           Print marginalia on the right margin.

       -P
           Print paragraph numbers on the left margin

OTHER OPTIONS
       These options are meant to be used when the program is called from a
       script, probably in conjunction with a specially prepared canon.
       Details for each book such as the block number, the text width etc.,
       are stored in the canon. To build canons for each corpus you need to
       process the files authtab.dir, doccan files and .idt files. tlg2u can
       be used to construct canons (see option -n).

       -B <block_number>
           TLG files are divided into 8Kb blocks. This option specifies the
           block number of the .txt file where the book to be converted
           begins. If not given it defaults to the value -1 and the program
           then will search the .idt file to find the block number. Normally
           this number will be read from a canon file containing such details.
           If this number is given it speeds up processing, especially for
           authors with large numbers of works. See also read_idt.c and
           find_bloc.c

       -M <width>
           Marginalia maximum text width in characters. Relevant only to utf
           output. pdf output does not need this option. If not given it will
           do one extra pass to find it. Normally this is retrieved from canon
           file.

       -n
           Print only the text width, marginalia width and line count. Used
           only for building canons.

       -p
           Pdf document output. Prints LaTeX markups used by XeTeX to typeset
           the text. You need to append appropriate preamble and postamble
           before passing this output through xelatex.

           The markups are as follows:

           o   Each output line is given a formate suitable for the xtabular
               environment and can be easily changed by editing the code found
               at the end of printing.c. The format of the output lines is as
               follows:

                   citations  &  main_text  &  line_numbers  &  marginalia

           o   Titles and other distinctive texts are rendered in bold, i.e.
               enclosed in {\bf ...}.

           o   Language shifts are indicated by the markups: \greek{} and
               \latin{}. In your preamble you should have definitions
               specifying the fonts, for example: \newfontfamily\latin{Times
               New Roman} and \newfontfamily\greek{Minion Pro}

       -T <width>
           Main text maximum width in characters. See also option -M

       -u
           Print only utf-8 text without any LaTeX markups. This is the
           default.

EXAMPLES
       tlg2u -L doccan2.txt
           Translate the TLG canon to unicode file. The -L option is set
           because the canon contains mainly Latin text. The few titles in
           Greek are indicated in the source file by language change marks and
           so will be printed correctly.

       tlg2u -a 0012 -b 001 -c tlg -d ./cdroms/tlge > Iliad.utf
           Convert Homer's Iliad to utf-8 encoded text (the default). Homer
           has author id: 0012 and the Iliad has book id: 001. The path of the
           input file is ./cdroms/tlge/tlg0012.txt. The results are sent to
           the file Iliad.utf which can be viewed with Open Office Writer or
           any other unicode capable editor/word processor.

       tlg2u -a 0448 -b 001 -L -C -c lat -d ./cdroms/phi5 > DeBello.txt
           Convert Caesar's De Bello Galico to utf-8. Append all citation
           numbers on the left margin. The input file is
           ./cdroms/phi5/lat0448.txt.

       tlg2u -a 0016 -b 001 -P -l -c tlg -d ./cdroms/phi5 > herod_hist.txt
           Convert Herodotus' Historiae, append section numbers to the left
           margin and line numbers to the right margin. The input file is
           ./cdroms/tlge/tlg0448.txt.
