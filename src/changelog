v 1.0.0 New makefile.  Uploaded to Github.

v 0.9.4 Error messages made more meaningful.

v 0.9.3 Corrected error in civ (e.g. civ0005_055) where some works did not print.
				In civ corpus when work number changes in mid block, level b is 
				incremented	with E0 81 instead of being reset with EF 80. 

v 0.9.2 Speed improvement. In beta_code.c check first if it is a vowel 
        and only then then look for accents. 

v 0.9.1 Corrected errors in incrementing citation data when these include
				ascii	characters. e.g in Plato (stephanus page) or Aristotle (Becker page)
				These are now incremented correctly. 
				Also clear id_data after 1st pass. This caused spurious data
				to be printed when whole files were processed from cmd line.

v 0.9.0 Removed special symbols option (-s) Not needed any more. Special fonts
				are now handled by XeTeX and Interchartoks.

v 0.8.6 Fixed escape_codes.c to output escaped '\\%' and '\\#' when pdf
				These are special symbols in TeX.

v 0.8.5 Changed apostrofos from 0x2019(sigle quote) to 0x1fbd(coronis)
				to be compatible with vim polytonic keymap, kadmos and vim polytonic
				spell checker. Also changed iota dialytika-oxia 0x1fd3 ->0x0390
				and ypsilon dialytika-oxia 0x1fe3 -> 0x03b0

v 0.8.4 Fixed again beta_code.c accents | and + after capital. Erroneous accents

v 0.8.3 Fixed in beta_code.c accents | and + after capital.(was looking too far)
				Also changed all (vowel + oxia) to (vowel + tonos) so that output is
				compatible with spell checkers and polytonic keymaps.

v 0.8.2 Bug fixes in escape_codes routine 
				replaced | with $|$ because of Latex ConText error.

v 0.8.1 Fixed multiple bold font error (escape_codes.c)
				'<20' followed by '<' no longer outputs 2 \bf{ 
				sequenses

v 0.8 Two pass processing to estimate text width.
			New routine handles conversion (convert.c)
			New command line arguments: Canon run option, Block number. 
			Improved printing.
			Fixed latin accents.


v 0.7 introduce command line arguments for author, book, dir, betastate.etc
			if a filename is given then process this file as is
			and disable book and block location.

v 0.6 Split each function to one file + header.
			Use make to compile.
			*# symbols (capital kopa, sampi, stigma) fixed.

v 0.5 prints line by line to std_out and perl collects lines 
			by executing via ` `.  No need for structures.

v 0.4 output to expandable array of stuctures
			function add_line uses malloc and realloc
			to construct data structure.
			Discontinued because. Too difficult to transfer 
			array of structures to perl
